Issues with cycling data type for android(Is listed as biking in the package but in health connect is cycling)
Sleep data recorded is only of the type "SLEEP_SESSION", for android at least(crosschecked here:https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/plan/data-types)
For some reason my systolic data fetch is abandoning it's health data type ,and randomly assigning itself some other data
